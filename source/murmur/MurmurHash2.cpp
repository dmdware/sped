// MurmurHash2, by Austin Appleby

// Note - This code makes a few assumptions about how your machine behaves -

// 1. We can read a 4-byte value from any address without crashing
// 2. sizeof(int) == 4

// And it has a few limitations -

// 1. It will not work incrementally.
// 2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
//    machines.

/*
For use with RenderTopo

Have list of yaw,pitch,roll,offx,offy values
that code as one key. The hash of that key is
modulus'd and indexes a jump table pixel,
that indexes the right pixel in the diffuse/positions textures.
Try with eg 2x2 jump table, to map to the right
diffuse/positions pixels. If that fails, keep
increasing jump table size until everything fits.

The yaw,pitch,roll,offx,offy bits are combined
into +/-28 bits, but hopefully nothing greater 
(16,16,16,256,256 values).

Also maybe try with different seed if collisions happen.
