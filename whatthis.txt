this is a sprite renderer/editor

you can design buildings with convex hulls, import milkshape 3d models

render instructions like tile orientations (for inclines) and 
gradience over several tiles (by cutting up a large texture), 
render animation frame ranges,
render from 8 different angles,
save your sprite projects, etc.
uses diffuse, specular, normal/bump mapping
and generates team colour map

also thinking about adding particle effect animation sprite rendering

all sprites are saved in .png format with transparency and .txt file with x,y offsets
